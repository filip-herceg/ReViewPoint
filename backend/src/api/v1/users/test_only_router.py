    Promote a regular user to admin status by email address.
    This endpoint is restricted to test environments for testing admin functionality.
    
    **Requirements:**
    - Must be running in test mode (TEST_MODE=true)
    - User must exist in the database
    - No authentication required (test endpoint)
    
    **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
        "email": "user@example.com"
    }
    ```
    
    **Behavior:**
    - Finds user by email address
    - Sets `is_admin` flag to `true`
    - Commits changes to database
    - Returns confirmation message
    
    **Example Request:**
    ```json
    {
        "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
    ```
    
    **Example Response:**
    ```json
    {
        "detail": "User john.doe@example.com promoted to admin."
    }
    ```
    
    **Security Notes:**
    - Automatically disabled in production environments
    - Returns 403 Forbidden if not in test mode
    - Use only for test setup and automation
    - Never expose in production APIs
