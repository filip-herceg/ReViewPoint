# Multi-stage Docker build for Python application with enhanced security
# 
# SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS MADE:
# 1. Upgraded from python:3.11-slim-bullseye (4 high vulnerabilities) to python:3.13-slim-bookworm (1 high vulnerability)
# 2. Used distroless runtime image (gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12:nonroot) - zero vulnerabilities
# 3. Added ca-certificates for secure SSL connections
# 4. Improved cleanup of temporary files and caches
# 5. Running as non-root user for security
#
# ALTERNATIVE: If you need shell access and database migration capabilities, 
# replace the distroless runtime with: FROM python:3.13-slim-bookworm AS runtime
# and restore the shell-based entrypoint script functionality.

# Base image for building dependencies - Updated to Python 3.13 for better security
FROM python:3.13-slim-bookworm AS builder
