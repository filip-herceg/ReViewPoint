.SYNOPSIS
    Fast upload test runner with optimized patterns
.DESCRIPTION
    Runs the optimized upload tests using the fastest available method.
    Automatically checks for Hatch and uses the backend virtual environment.
    
    MODES EXPLAINED:
    - fast: Uses SQLite in-memory DB (8.5s) - FASTEST, ideal for CI/development
    - parallel: 4 workers with SQLite (12s) - Good for development, tests run in parallel
    - regular: PostgreSQL with single thread (8.5s) - Tests real DB but slower startup
    
.PARAMETER Mode
    Test execution mode: fast, parallel, or regular
.EXAMPLE
    .\run_upload_tests.ps1 fast
.EXAMPLE
    .\run_upload_tests.ps1 parallel
