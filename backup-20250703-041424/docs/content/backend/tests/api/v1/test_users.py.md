# test_users.py

## Purpose

Tests the user-related API endpoints in `api/v1/users.py`.

## Test Cases

- **User registration:** Verifies new users can register via the API.
- **User login:** Ensures users can authenticate and receive tokens.
- **User profile:** Checks retrieval and update of user profile data.
- **Permissions:** Ensures endpoints enforce authentication and permissions.

## Expected Outcome

- All user API endpoints behave as intended, with correct authentication, validation, and error handling.
