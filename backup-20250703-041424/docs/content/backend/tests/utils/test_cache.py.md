# test_cache.py

## Purpose

Tests the caching utilities in `utils/cache.py`.

## Test Cases

- **Cache set/get:** Verifies that values can be stored and retrieved from the cache.
- **Cache expiration:** Ensures cached values expire as expected.
- **Cache clear:** Checks that the cache can be cleared/reset.

## Expected Outcome

- All cache operations behave as intended, with correct storage, retrieval, and expiration.
