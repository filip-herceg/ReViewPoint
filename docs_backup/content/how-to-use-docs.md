# How to Use This Documentation

Welcome to the ReViewPoint documentation! This guide will help you get the most out of our docs, whether youâ€™re a new contributor, developer, or user.

## Navigation Tips

- Use the sidebar to browse by section (Backend, Frontend, Development, Modules, etc.).
- Use the search bar (top right) for instant lookup of files, APIs, or guides.
- Each file and directory has its own documentation page, cross-referenced for easy exploration.
- Use the collapsible navigation and tabs for a clean, focused reading experience.

## Features

- **Admonitions**: Look for callouts like `!!! note`, `!!! warning`, and `!!! tip` for important info.
- **Tabs**: Some docs use tabs to show code in multiple languages or scenarios.
- **Cross-references**: Links between files, tests, and related modules for context.

## Getting Started

- Start with the [Setup Guide](setup.md) and [System Overview](architecture.md).
- Use the Backend/Frontend Source Guides for deep dives into code structure.
