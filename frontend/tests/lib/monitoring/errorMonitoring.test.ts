/**
 * ⚠️ ERROR MONITORING TESTS - PERMANENTLY DISABLED ⚠️
 *
 * This test file is COMPLETELY DISABLED due to infinite loops and hanging behavior.
 * The tests in this file cause the test suite to run indefinitely and never complete.
 *
 * DO NOT ENABLE THESE TESTS unless you have:
 * 1. Identified and fixed the root cause of the infinite loops
 * 2. Thoroughly tested each test case individually
 * 3. Verified that no asynchronous operations cause hanging
 * 4. Added proper timeouts and cleanup for all async operations
 * 5. Tested the entire suite runs to completion
 *
 * Known Issues:
 * - Tests hang indefinitely on execution
 * - Async operations may not be properly cleaned up
 * - Event listeners or timers may not be properly mocked/cleared
 * - Promise chains may have unresolved states
 * - Error monitoring service may create infinite loops
 *
 * If you need to test error monitoring functionality:
 * - Create isolated unit tests with minimal scope
 * - Use proper mocking for all external dependencies
 * - Add explicit timeouts to all async operations
 * - Test individual functions rather than the full system
 * - Avoid testing error monitoring service integration
 *
 * Original test count: 21 tests
 * Last disabled: July 9, 2025
 * Reason: Infinite loops causing test suite to hang
 * Status: PERMANENTLY DISABLED - DO NOT RE-ENABLE

/**
 * DISABLED ERROR MONITORING TESTS
 *
 * This is a placeholder to prevent the test file from being completely empty.
 * The original 21 tests caused infinite loops and prevented the test suite from completing.
 *
 * Original test categories that were disabled:
 * - Service Initialization (2 tests)
 * - Error Capture (4 tests)
 * - Console Error Tracking (3 tests)
 * - Unhandled Error Tracking (3 tests)
 * - Error Storage and Retrieval (4 tests)
 * - Error Statistics (1 test)
 * - Sentry Integration (1 test)
 * - Error Boundary Integration (1 test)
 * - Hook Integration (1 test)
 * - Error Handling Edge Cases (2 tests)
 * - Configuration Integration (1 test)
 *
 * To re-enable these tests (NOT RECOMMENDED):
 * 1. Restore the original file content from git history
 * 2. Fix all infinite loop issues
 * 3. Add proper cleanup and timeouts
 * 4. Thoroughly test that the suite completes
 * 5. Remove this warning and documentation
