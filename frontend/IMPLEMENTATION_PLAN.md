### Infrastructure Foundation

- Husky is now set up in the monorepo root (`.git` in `ReViewPoint/`).
- Pre-commit hook runs lint and format in `frontend/` via pnpm, as required for a monorepo.
- No Node.js or package.json is needed in the root for frontend-only tooling, but Husky does require a minimal root package.json (now present).
- All Git hooks are managed from the root and delegate to frontend scripts.
- This setup is robust, cross-platform, and works for all contributors.

## 🎯 **Key Design Principles**

### **1. API Integration Guidelines:**

```typescript
// Consistent error handling
const useApiCall = (endpoint: string) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: [endpoint],
    queryFn: () => apiClient.get(endpoint),
    retry: 3,
    retryDelay: attemptIndex => Math.min(1000 * 2 ** attemptIndex, 30000),
    onError: (error) => {
      toast.error(`API Error: ${error.message}`);
    }
  });
};
```

### **2. Component Design Guidelines:**

```typescript
// Consistent props structure
interface ComponentProps {
  children?: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
  variant?: 'default' | 'primary' | 'secondary';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  disabled?: boolean;
  loading?: boolean;
}
```

### **3. State Management Patterns:**

```typescript
// Zustand store structure
interface AppState {
  // UI State
  theme: 'light' | 'dark';
  sidebarOpen: boolean;
  
  // User State
  user: User | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  
  // Feature State
  uploads: Upload[];
  currentUpload: Upload | null;
}
```
