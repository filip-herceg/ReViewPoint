# Backend Test Suite Documentation

This document provides an overview of the backend test suite for the ReViewPoint project.

## Purpose

The backend test suite ensures the reliability, correctness, and security of all backend modules, including API endpoints, models, utilities, and services.

## Structure

- **api/** — Tests for API endpoints (e.g., user, auth, uploads)
- **models/** — Tests for database models
- **repositories/** — Tests for repository/data access logic
- **services/** — Tests for business logic and service layer
- **utils/** — Tests for utility modules (hashing, validation, etc.)
- **middlewares/** — Tests for middleware components

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive test names and docstrings
- Test both typical and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies where appropriate
- Ensure tests are isolated and repeatable
- Maintain high code coverage

## Running Tests

Run all backend tests with:

```sh
hatch run test
```

Or use `pytest` directly if preferred.
