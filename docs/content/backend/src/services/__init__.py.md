## 1. Purpose

This file initializes the services package, which contains the business logic layer of the ReViewPoint backend application. Services orchestrate operations between the API layer and data access layer.

## 2. Service Architecture

The services package implements the business logic for core platform features:

### Core Services
- **User Service**: Account management, profile operations, and user authentication
- **Paper Service**: Paper submission, metadata processing, and search functionality
- **Review Service**: Review assignment, submission handling, and workflow management
- **Auth Service**: Authentication, authorization, and session management

### Supporting Services
- **File Service**: Document upload, storage, and retrieval operations
- **Email Service**: Notification and communication management
- **Search Service**: Full-text search and filtering capabilities
- **Analytics Service**: Usage tracking and reporting functionality

## 3. Design Patterns

Services follow established architectural patterns:

- **Dependency Injection**: Services receive dependencies through constructor injection
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access through repository abstractions
- **Unit of Work**: Transaction management and data consistency
- **Command/Query Separation**: Clear separation of read and write operations

## 4. Business Logic Implementation

Services encapsulate complex business rules:

- **Validation**: Business rule validation beyond basic data validation
- **Orchestration**: Multi-step operations across multiple repositories
- **Event Handling**: Domain events and side effect management
- **Error Handling**: Business exception handling and error recovery

## 5. Integration Points

Services integrate with multiple layers:

- **API Layer**: Called by FastAPI route handlers
- **Repository Layer**: Uses repositories for data persistence
- **External APIs**: Integrates with third-party services
- **Background Tasks**: Schedules and executes async operations

## 6. Testing Strategy

Services are designed for comprehensive testing:

- **Unit Tests**: Isolated testing with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end business logic validation
- **Mock Support**: Easy mocking for dependency isolation
- **Test Fixtures**: Reusable test data and scenarios
