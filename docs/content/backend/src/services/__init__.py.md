# Services Package - Business Logic Implementation

## Purpose

The services package implements the core business logic layer for the ReViewPoint platform, providing high-level operations that coordinate between repositories, models, and external systems. This package contains service classes and functions that encapsulate complex business workflows, enforce business rules, and manage application state while maintaining clear separation from data access and presentation concerns.

## Key Components

### Service Modules

The services package includes specialized modules for different business domains:

- **User Services** (`user.py`) - Complete user lifecycle management including authentication, profile management, password operations, and role-based access control
- **Upload Services** (`upload.py`) - File upload and management operations with security validation and storage coordination

### Business Logic Architecture

The services layer provides:

- **Business Rule Enforcement** - Complex validation and business logic beyond simple data validation
- **Workflow Coordination** - Multi-step operations that span multiple repositories and models
- **External Integration** - Coordination with external systems, APIs, and services
- **Transaction Management** - Proper transaction boundaries for complex operations
- **Error Handling** - Business-specific error handling and exception management

## Architecture Integration

### Layered Architecture Position

The services layer sits between the API and repository layers:

```
API Layer (FastAPI endpoints)
    ↓
Services Layer (Business logic)
    ↓
Repository Layer (Data access)
    ↓
Models Layer (ORM entities)
```

### Dependency Management

Services coordinate multiple lower-level components:
- **Repositories** for data access operations
- **Models** for entity definitions and relationships
- **Schemas** for data validation and serialization
- **Core utilities** for configuration, security, and logging
- **External services** for integrations and third-party APIs

## Common Patterns

### Service Class Pattern

Many services follow a class-based pattern for dependency injection:

```python
class UserService:
    async def register_user(self, session: AsyncSession, data: Mapping[str, object]) -> User:
        # Business logic implementation
        pass
```

### Function-Based Services

Simple operations may use function-based patterns:

```python
async def authenticate_user(session: AsyncSession, email: str, password: str) -> tuple[str, str]:
    # Authentication business logic
    pass
```

### Error Handling Strategy

Services implement comprehensive error handling:
- **Business validation errors** - Custom exceptions for business rule violations
- **External system errors** - Graceful handling of third-party service failures
- **Transaction rollback** - Proper cleanup on operation failures
- **Audit logging** - Security and compliance logging for business operations

## Business Logic Domains

### User Management

The user service domain includes:
- **Registration workflows** with validation and verification
- **Authentication operations** including JWT token management
- **Profile management** with preferences and avatar handling
- **Password operations** including reset workflows and security validation
- **Account lifecycle** including deactivation, deletion, and anonymization
- **Role-based access control** with permission management

### File Management

The upload service domain includes:
- **File upload operations** with security validation and storage
- **File metadata management** with database coordination
- **Access control** ensuring users can only access their files
- **Storage management** with cleanup and optimization
- **File type validation** with security scanning

## Security Integration

### Authentication Security

Services implement comprehensive authentication security:
- **Password validation** with strength requirements and character restrictions
- **JWT token management** with proper expiration and blacklisting
- **Rate limiting** for authentication attempts and token refresh
- **Audit logging** for all authentication and authorization events

### Authorization Patterns

Services enforce authorization through:
- **Role-based access control** with hierarchical permissions
- **Resource ownership** verification for user-specific operations
- **Operation-level permissions** for fine-grained access control
- **Context-aware authorization** based on request context and user state

### Data Protection

Services implement data protection measures:
- **Input validation** and sanitization for all user inputs
- **Output filtering** to prevent information disclosure
- **Audit trails** for compliance and security monitoring
- **Data anonymization** for privacy compliance (GDPR/CCPA)

## Transaction Management

### Database Transactions

Services manage database transactions properly:
- **Atomic operations** ensuring data consistency across multiple tables
- **Rollback handling** for failed operations with proper cleanup
- **Session management** with proper connection lifecycle
- **Deadlock prevention** through consistent operation ordering

### External System Coordination

Services coordinate with external systems:
- **Compensation patterns** for distributed transaction scenarios
- **Idempotency** ensuring operations can be safely retried
- **Circuit breaker patterns** for resilient external service integration
- **Eventual consistency** handling for asynchronous operations

## Performance Considerations

### Async Operations

Services leverage async patterns for performance:
- **Non-blocking I/O** for database and external API operations
- **Concurrent processing** for independent operations
- **Connection pooling** for efficient resource utilization
- **Caching strategies** for frequently accessed data

### Resource Management

Services implement efficient resource usage:
- **Memory management** with proper object lifecycle
- **File handling** with cleanup and temporary storage management
- **Connection management** with proper session handling
- **Rate limiting** to prevent resource exhaustion

## Testing Support

### Business Logic Testing

Services support comprehensive testing:
- **Unit testing** for individual business operations
- **Integration testing** for multi-component workflows
- **Mock support** for external dependencies
- **Test data management** with proper setup and teardown

### Test Isolation

Services enable proper test isolation:
- **Transaction rollback** for database test isolation
- **Mock external services** to prevent side effects
- **Deterministic behavior** for repeatable test results
- **Environment separation** for test, development, and production

## Configuration Management

### Settings Integration

Services integrate with application configuration:
- **Environment-specific behavior** through settings injection
- **Feature flags** for conditional business logic
- **External service configuration** with proper secret management
- **Performance tuning** through configurable parameters

### Development vs Production

Services adapt behavior for different environments:
- **Development shortcuts** for faster development cycles
- **Production security** with full validation and logging
- **Test configurations** with mock services and deterministic behavior
- **Debug support** with enhanced logging and introspection

## Monitoring and Observability

### Business Metrics

Services provide business-level monitoring:
- **Operation success rates** for business workflow monitoring
- **Performance metrics** for business operation timing

## Integration Patterns

### API Layer Integration

Services integrate cleanly with the API layer:
- **DTO conversion** between API schemas and service models
- **Error translation** from service exceptions to HTTP responses
- **Async support** for non-blocking API operations
- **Validation coordination** between API and service layers

### Repository Layer Coordination

Services coordinate effectively with repositories:
- **Transaction boundaries** spanning multiple repository operations
- **Query coordination** for complex data retrieval needs
- **Bulk operations** for performance optimization
- **Relationship management** for complex entity interactions

## Error Handling Strategies

### Business Exception Hierarchy

Services define clear exception hierarchies:
- **ValidationError** for business rule violations

- **UserAlreadyExistsError** for uniqueness constraint violations
- **AuthenticationError** for security-related failures

### Error Recovery

Services implement error recovery patterns:
- **Retry mechanisms** for transient failures
- **Fallback strategies** for degraded functionality
- **Circuit breaker patterns** for external service failures
- **Graceful degradation** for non-critical functionality
