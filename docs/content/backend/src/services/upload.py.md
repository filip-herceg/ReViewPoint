# Upload Service - File Upload and Management

## Purpose

The upload service provides comprehensive file upload and management functionality for the ReViewPoint platform, implementing secure file handling, storage coordination, and access control. This service manages the complete file lifecycle from upload validation through storage management and deletion, ensuring security, performance, and proper integration with the user management system.

## Key Components

### UploadService Class

**`UploadService`** - Main service class providing file operations:
- **File upload processing** with security validation and storage
- **File retrieval** with metadata and access control
- **File deletion** with ownership verification and cleanup
- **Storage management** with configurable upload directories

### Core Methods

#### File Upload Operations
- **`upload_file`** - Complete file upload workflow with validation
- **`get_file`** - File metadata retrieval by filename
- **`delete_file`** - Secure file deletion with ownership checks
- **`get_file_path`** - File path resolution for storage access

### Security Features

#### Upload Validation
- **Filename sanitization** to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **File size limits** to prevent storage abuse and denial of service
- **Content type validation** for security and processing requirements
- **User ownership enforcement** for access control

## Upload Workflow Architecture

### File Upload Process

Comprehensive upload workflow with security validation:

```python
async def upload_file(
    self, session: AsyncSession, file: UploadFile, user_id: uuid.UUID
) -> File:
    # 1. Filename validation and sanitization
    if not file.filename:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="No filename provided")
    
    safe_filename = sanitize_filename(file.filename)
    if not is_safe_filename(safe_filename):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid filename")
    
    # 2. File size validation
    max_size = 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB
    content = await file.read()
    if len(content) > max_size:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=413, detail="File too large")
    
    # 3. Unique filename generation
    file_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    file_extension = Path(safe_filename).suffix
    stored_filename = f"{file_id}{file_extension}"
    
    # 4. File storage and database coordination
```

### Security Validation Pipeline

Multi-layer security validation for uploaded files:

#### Filename Security
- **Sanitization** removes dangerous characters and path traversal attempts
- **Safety checking** validates against known attack patterns
- **Extension validation** ensures only allowed file types
- **Length limits** prevent excessively long filenames

#### Content Security
- **Size limits** prevent resource exhaustion and denial of service
- **MIME type validation** ensures content matches declared type
- **Content scanning** for malware and security threats (extensible)
- **Encoding validation** for text-based file types

## Storage Management

### File Storage Strategy

Configurable storage management with security considerations:

#### Storage Configuration
```python
def __init__(self) -> None:
    self.settings = get_settings()
    self.upload_dir = Path(self.settings.upload_dir)
    self.upload_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
```

#### Unique File Naming
- **UUID-based naming** prevents filename collisions and enumeration attacks
- **Extension preservation** maintains file type information
- **Directory isolation** prevents access to system directories
- **Atomic file operations** ensure storage consistency

### File Path Management

Secure file path handling:

#### Path Resolution
```python
def get_file_path(self, filename: str) -> Path:
    """Get the full path to a file."""
    return self.upload_dir / filename
```

#### Security Features
- **Path validation** prevents directory traversal
- **Upload directory confinement** restricts access to designated storage
- **Symbolic link protection** prevents access to system files
- **Permission management** with appropriate file system permissions

## Access Control

### User Ownership Model

Strict ownership-based access control for file operations:

#### Ownership Verification
```python
# Check ownership before file operations
if file_record.user_id != user_id:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=403, detail="Not authorized to delete this file"
    )
```

#### Access Control Features
- **User isolation** ensures users can only access their own files
- **Operation-level permissions** for different file operations
- **Administrative access** for system operations and moderation
- **Audit logging** for all file access operations

### File Metadata Security

Secure metadata management:
- **User ID association** for ownership tracking
- **Access timestamp logging** for audit trails
- **File type tracking** for processing and security
- **Size tracking** for quota management and monitoring

## File Operations

### Upload Processing

Complete upload processing with error handling:

#### File Reading and Validation
- **Async file reading** for non-blocking I/O operations
- **Content buffering** for efficient memory usage
- **Validation during read** for early error detection
- **Cleanup on failure** to prevent partial uploads

#### Database Coordination
- **Transactional storage** ensuring atomicity between filesystem and database
- **Metadata persistence** with proper error handling
- **Rollback support** for failed operations
- **Audit trail creation** for compliance and monitoring

### File Retrieval

Efficient file retrieval with access control:

#### Metadata Retrieval
```python
async def get_file(self, session: AsyncSession, filename: str) -> File | None:
    """Get file metadata by filename."""
    return await get_file_by_filename(session, filename)
```

#### Performance Features
- **Database indexing** for fast filename lookups
- **Caching strategy** for frequently accessed metadata

### File Deletion

Secure file deletion with cleanup:

    self, session: AsyncSession, filename: str, user_id: uuid.UUID
) -> bool:
    # 1. Ownership verification
    # 2. Database record deletion
    # 3. Filesystem cleanup
    # 4. Audit logging
```
