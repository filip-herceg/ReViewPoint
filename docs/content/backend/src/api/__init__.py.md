## 1. Purpose

This file initializes the API package for the ReViewPoint backend. While currently empty, it serves as the package marker that allows Python to recognize the `api` directory as a proper Python package.

## 2. Package Organization

The API package is organized as follows:

- **Root level**: Common API utilities and dependencies
- **v1/**: Version 1 API endpoints grouped by functionality
- **Versioning**: Future API versions can be added as separate directories (v2/, v3/, etc.)

## 3. Design Philosophy

The API package follows these principles:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each endpoint group has its own module
- **Dependency Injection**: Common dependencies are centralized in `deps.py`
- **Version Management**: API versions are clearly separated
- **OpenAPI Standards**: Full compliance with OpenAPI 3.0 specification

## 4. Related Files

- [`deps.py`](deps.py.md) - Dependency injection utilities
- [`v1/`](v1/__init__.py.md) - Version 1 API implementation
- [`../main.py`](../main.py.md) - Main application that mounts this API

This package initialization file maintains the structural integrity of the API module while keeping the codebase organized and maintainable.
