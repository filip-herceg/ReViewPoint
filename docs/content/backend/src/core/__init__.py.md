## 1. Purpose

This file serves as the package initialization marker for the core module, which contains the fundamental infrastructure components of the ReViewPoint backend application.

## 2. Core Module Responsibilities

The core package provides essential services that form the foundation of the application:

### Infrastructure Services
- **Database Management**: Async SQLAlchemy engine and session handling
- **Configuration**: Environment-based settings with validation
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and cryptographic operations
- **Logging**: Centralized logging configuration and structured output

### Application Framework
- **Event System**: Application lifecycle and custom event handling
- **Feature Flags**: Runtime feature toggles for safe deployments
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger configuration and generation
- **Type System**: Custom type definitions and type safety utilities

## 3. Design Principles

The core module follows these architectural principles:

- **Foundation Layer**: Provides abstractions that other modules depend on
- **No Upward Dependencies**: Does not import from business logic layers
- **Async-First**: Built for high-performance non-blocking operations
- **Configuration-Driven**: All behavior is configurable through environment settings
- **Security-Focused**: Security considerations are built into every component

## 4. Module Dependencies

Core modules are imported throughout the application:
- API layer uses core for database sessions and authentication
- Services layer uses core for logging and configuration
- Repository layer uses core for database connections
- Middleware uses core for security and logging

## 5. Related Documentation

- [`config.py`](config.py.md) - Application configuration system
- [`database.py`](database.py.md) - Database connectivity and session management
- [`security.py`](security.py.md) - Authentication and security utilities
- [`logging.py`](logging.py.md) - Structured logging configuration

This package initialization maintains the structural integrity while ensuring proper module organization.
