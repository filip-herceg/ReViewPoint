# Test: frontend/src/pages/[PageName].test.md

This file documents the tests for a frontend page component.

## Purpose

Ensure the page renders correctly, integrates with child components, and handles routing/data fetching.

## Example Test Structure

```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import PageName from './PageName';

test('renders page and child components', () => {
  render(<PageName />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Expected Page Content')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## What to Test

- Page layout and structure
- Integration with child components
- Data fetching and error handling

## Best Practices

- Use React Testing Library for assertions
- Mock API calls and router context as needed
