<!-- Coverage Badge -->

This is a placeholder for the test coverage badge. The actual badge will be generated by CI and placed here as `coverage.svg`.

## What is a Coverage Badge?

A coverage badge visually represents the percentage of code covered by automated tests. It is updated automatically by the CI pipeline after each test run.

- **Green:** High coverage (e.g., 90%+)
- **Yellow:** Moderate coverage
- **Red:** Low coverage (needs improvement)

## How to Update

- Run the test suite with coverage enabled (see CI workflow).
- The badge will be generated and committed to this location.
