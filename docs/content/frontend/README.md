# Frontend Architecture Overview

## Purpose

The ReViewPoint frontend is a modern React application built with TypeScript, providing a sophisticated user interface for the scientific paper review platform. This document provides an overview of the most critical frontend components and architecture patterns.

## Core Architecture Layers

### 1. Application Bootstrap Layer
- **[main.tsx](src/main.tsx.md)** - React application entry point with initialization pipeline
- **[App.tsx](src/App.tsx.md)** - Main application component with provider architecture
- **[analytics.ts](src/analytics.ts.md)** - Privacy-focused analytics integration

### 2. Core Library Layer (`lib/`)

#### Configuration Management
- **[queryClient.ts](src/lib/queryClient.ts.md)** - TanStack React Query configuration
- **[config/environment.ts](src/lib/config/environment.ts.md)** - Environment configuration with validation
- **[config/featureFlags.ts](src/lib/config/featureFlags.ts.md)** - Feature flag management system

#### API & Data Layer
- **[api/base.ts](src/lib/api/base.ts.md)** - Base API client with authentication
- **api/auth.ts** - Authentication API endpoints
- **api/uploads.ts** - File upload API integration
- **api/health.ts** - Health check endpoints

#### State Management
- **[store/authStore.ts](src/lib/store/authStore.ts.md)** - Authentication state with Zustand
- **store/uiStore.ts** - UI state management
- **store/uploadStore.ts** - File upload state
- **store/webSocketStore.ts** - Real-time communication state

#### Supporting Libraries
- **auth/** - Authentication services and token management
- **router/** - React Router configuration
- **theme/** - Styling and theme system
- **utils/** - Utility functions and helpers
- **validation/** - Form and data validation
- **websocket/** - WebSocket communication services
- **monitoring/** - Performance and error monitoring

### 3. Component Architecture (`components/`)

#### UI Components (`ui/`)
- Reusable UI components built with Tailwind CSS
- Accessible, responsive design components
- Consistent design system implementation

#### Feature Components
- **auth/** - Authentication forms and flows
- **uploads/** - File upload interface
- **file-management/** - File management UI
- **layout/** - Application layout components
- **navigation/** - Navigation and routing components

### 4. Application Features

#### Authentication System
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control
- Secure token management and storage
- Social login integration (feature flagged)

#### File Management
- Drag-and-drop file uploads
- Progress tracking and preview
- Multiple file support
- PDF processing integration

#### Real-time Features
- WebSocket communication for live updates
- Real-time collaboration features
- Live notifications and status updates

#### Performance & Monitoring
- Error boundary integration
- Performance monitoring with analytics
- Feature flag-driven development
- Comprehensive logging system

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **React 18+** - Modern React with concurrent features
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework

### State Management
- **Zustand** - Lightweight state management
- **TanStack Query** - Server state management
- **React Router** - Client-side routing

### Development Tools
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting
- **Vitest** - Unit testing framework
- **Playwright** - End-to-end testing
- **TypeScript** - Static type checking

## Key Design Patterns

### Provider Architecture
The application uses a comprehensive provider pattern with:
- QueryClientProvider for data fetching
- ThemeProvider for styling
- ErrorBoundary for error handling
- LiveRegionProvider for accessibility

### State Management Strategy
- **Global State**: Authentication, UI preferences, WebSocket connections
- **Server State**: API data managed by TanStack Query
- **Local State**: Component-specific state with React hooks

### Error Handling
- Global error boundaries for React errors
- API error handling with retry logic
- Comprehensive logging with context
- User-friendly error messages

### Performance Optimization
- Code splitting with React.lazy()
- Component lazy loading
- Optimized bundle sizes
- Efficient re-rendering patterns

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Security
- Secure token storage and management
- Automatic token refresh
- Protected route handling
- CSRF protection with credentials

### Data Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure API communication
- Privacy-focused analytics
- Error message sanitization

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development
1. Feature flag definition
2. Component development with TypeScript
3. State management integration
4. API integration with error handling
5. Testing (unit and E2E)
6. Documentation updates

### Quality Assurance
- Type checking with TypeScript
- Linting with Biome
- Unit tests with Vitest
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Performance monitoring

## Next Steps

The frontend architecture provides a solid foundation for:
- AI-powered review features
- Advanced collaboration tools
- Enhanced file processing
- Real-time communication
- Mobile application development
