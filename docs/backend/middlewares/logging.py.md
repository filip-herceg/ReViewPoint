# `middlewares/logging.py`

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Layer** | Middleware |
| **Responsibility** | Implements FastAPI middleware for HTTP request/response logging with unique request IDs and timing, using [loguru](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/) for all logging. |
| **Status** | ðŸŸ¢ Done |

## 1. Purpose  
Adds a unique request ID to each HTTP request, logs request and response details (including timing), and attaches the request ID to logs and response headers for traceability.

## 2. Public API  
| Symbol | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `RequestLoggingMiddleware` | class | FastAPI middleware for logging requests/responses |
| `get_request_id` | function | Returns the current request ID for the active request |

> **Note:** As of May 2025, all logging is handled via [loguru](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/). The previous `RequestIdFilter` is deprecated and no longer used. Structured logging is supported via loguru's `bind()` method.

## 3. Behaviour & Edge-Cases  
- Each request gets a unique ID (or uses `X-Request-ID` header if provided).
- Request ID is stored in a context variable for access throughout the request lifecycle.
- Middleware logs incoming requests, outgoing responses, and errors with timing and request context using loguru structured logging.
- Excludes certain paths (e.g., `/health`, `/metrics`) from logging by default.
- Attaches request ID to response headers for client correlation.
- Handles context variable reset to avoid leaks between requests.

## 4. Dependencies  
- **Internal**: None
- **External**:
  - `loguru` (third-party)
  - `fastapi`, `starlette` (for middleware and request/response handling)
  - `uuid`, `contextvars`, `time` (standard library)

## 5. Tests  
| Test file | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| `backend/tests/middlewares/test_logging.py` | Tests request ID generation, logging, error handling, and propagation |

## 6. Open TODOs  
- [ ] Add configuration for excluded paths via environment or settings
- [ ] Add support for structured logging (e.g., JSON) in middleware logs

> **Update this page whenever the implementation changes.**

## 7. Migration Notes
- All middleware logging is now handled by loguru. Use `from loguru import logger` and `logger.bind()` for structured context.
- Example usage:
  ```python
  from loguru import logger
  logger.bind(request_id="...").info("message")
  ```
